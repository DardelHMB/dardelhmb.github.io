These guides need a revamp, too. I'm probably going to use the same docsify theme for them. But I think the guides themselves are pretty good, but please feel free to correct me if there's anything wrong with them. Best way to do so is to open up a pull request on the respective github repository (or open an issue to suggest but not make changes)
