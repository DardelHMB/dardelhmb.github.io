## Big changes
*Dardel 26/10/23*

So you may have noticed that this website has changed a lot recently.
New pages, better theme, overall a much needed revamp.

My plan was to release these changes on my own, locally hosted website. But I'm still waiting on a domain, so it will have to wait for now.
When this happens, https://dardelhmb.github.io will redirect to the new domain.

I'm not going to write a changelog, you can have a look and see what's new if you want. 

#### License change
